### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Entrepreneur, Blockchain enthusiast, co-founder of Lightrains Technolabs

Outside of my work, I try to expand my views through new experiences while taking every opportunity to learn from them. I do this because I think that the best Entrepreneurs understands not just the ecosystem, but the world and people in it; the thing that we are ultimately living for. I also enjoy reading about design, startup, Blockchain and Ethereum.
